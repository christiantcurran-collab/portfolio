    "question": "What are a firm's obligations under Treating Customers Fairly?",
    "answer": "**Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)** is primarily grounded in **Principle 6** (PRIN 2.1.6R), which states that a firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.\n\nThe FCA has set out **six consumer outcomes** that firms should strive to deliver:\n\n1. **Culture** — Consumers can be confident they are dealing with firms where the fair treatment of customers is central to the corporate culture\n2. **Product design** — Products and services marketed and sold in the retail market are designed to meet the needs of identified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly\n3. **Clear information** — Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept appropriately informed before, during and after the point of sale\n4. **Suitable advice** — Where consumers receive advice, the advice is suitable and takes account of their circumstances\n5. **Product performance** — Consumers are provided with products that perform as firms have led them to expect, and the associated service is of an acceptable standard\n6. **No unreasonable barriers** — Consumers do not face unreasonable post-sale barriers imposed by firms to change product, switch provider, submit a claim or make a complaint\n\nSince July 2023, these obligations have been reinforced by the **Consumer Duty** (Principle 12, PRIN 2A), which requires firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers through:\n- Acting in good faith\n- Avoiding causing foreseeable harm\n- Enabling and supporting customers to pursue their financial objectives",
